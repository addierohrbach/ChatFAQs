    considerations may prevent a Reason for Visit from being scheduled:, '\n', 
Patients who are new to a specialty may need to call in and speak to a scheduler in order to establish a new
        relationship with a provider. The schedulers are able to help take into account certain insurance coverage
        issues and provider sub-specialties to help you select the clinician most suited to your needs. Please refer
        to our provider directory for more
        information or to find a provider.
    
In general, visits that require pre-work such as labs or procedures will require you to call and make your
        appointment.
    
Immunizations, vaccinations, and flu shots require supplies to be checked prior to scheduling an appointment to
        ensure sufficient stock.
    
Visits for more than one appointment reason have special duration considerations that must be handled by a
        scheduler.
    
Some Pre-op and Post-op visits have very specific timing restrictions.
