                <p>MyChart offers patients personalized and secure on-line access to portions of their medical records.
                    It enables you to securely use the Internet to help manage and receive information about your
                    health*. With MyChart or the MyNM app, you can use the Internet to:</p>
                <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>Send secure electronic messages to your doctor's office.</li>

                <p>Neither MyChart nor the MyNM app should be used for urgent matters. If you are experiencing a
                    life-threatening illness or injury, please go to the nearest hospital emergency department and/or

                <p>Both the MyNM app and MyChart are free services offered to our patients. Some features, like certain

                <h2 id="EQ_sign">How do I sign up for NM MyChart?</h2>
                <p>NM MyChart requires that you have an Access Code in order to enroll and create an account. There are
                    a few ways you can get an Access Code:</p>
                <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>During an office visit with your doctor, check-in staff may ask if you are interested in
                        enrolling and send you an email with an Access Code.</li>
                    <li>If you aren't asked to enroll during check-in, you should receive an Access Code on your visit
                        summary paperwork before you leave the office.</li>
                    <li>If you don't have an upcoming appointment or don't want to wait, you can always visit the <a
                            href="https://myc.nm.org/MyChart/default.asp?mode=stdfile&amp;option=SE_Access&amp;_ga=2.190000811.1467205995.1547159809-1465696264.1522082464"

                <h2 id="EQ_access">What is an Access Code?</h2>
                <p>An Access Code allows you to quickly sign up for your MyChart account and for the system to associate
                    this new account with your existing medical record. You may have received an access code in your
                    doctor's office via email or on your After Visit Summary paperwork. If you never received an access
                    code, or if your access code is expired or doesn't work, you can request a new one at any time and
                    have it sent to you via email, text message, or letter - depending on your preference.
                    Alternatively, you can select the "I don't have an Access Code" button on the MyChart login page to
                    begin the direct self-signup process. </p>

                <h2 id="EQ_expired">What should I do if my Access Code is disabled or does not work?</h2>
                <p>For your security, your Access Code expires after 90 days and is no longer valid after the first time
                    you use it. If you've already received an Access Code, but it is disabled, expired, or does not
                    work, you do not need to contact your doctor.</p>

                <h2 id="EQ_username">Is my Access Code my username? </h2>
                <p>No, your Access Code is not your MyChart username or password. You will use this code only once in
                    order to log into MyChart for the first time (the code will expire once you use it or after 90
                    days). During your initial MyChart login, you will be asked to create your own unique MyChart
                    username and password, which you will use for your subsequent logins.</p>

                    interested in signing up for MyChart? </h2>
                <p>In order to sign up for a MyChart account, you must be an established patient of Northwestern
                    Medicine. You are an established patient if one of the following can apply to you:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>If you're interested in setting up your first appointment with a Northwestern Medicine doctor, please
                    contact our Patient Services Center at 312-695-1920 or you can request an appointment by filling out

                <h1>About the MyNM App</h1>
                <hr noshade="">
                <h2 id="NM_diffnm">What is the difference between MyChart and the MyNM app?</h2>
                <p>MyChart is the tool that Northwestern Medicine uses to offer patients personalized and secure on-line
                    access to portions of their medical records. MyChart can be accessed on a desktop computer using an
                    Internet Browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer. MyNM is Northwestern Medicine’s
                    mobile app which makes accessing MyChart easier for patients using a mobile device like a phone or
                    tablet. MyNM contains MyChart, as well as many other helpful features.</p>
                <p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
                <h2 id="NM_already">I already have the MyChart app on my phone - can I continue to use the MyChart app
                    instead of MyNM?</h2>
                <p>No. To continue using MyChart to access your Northwestern Medicine health information on a mobile
                    device, you will need to use the MyNM app. Our new app offers enhanced capabilities not available in
                    the MyChart app. Access to MyChart from a desktop computer is not changing.</p>
                <p>If you also use the MyChart app to access health records from other, non-Northwestern Medicine health
                    systems, you may need to keep the MyChart app on your phone.</p>

                <h2 id="NM_get">How do I get the MyNM app?</h2>
                <p>Text MYNM to 43506 to receive a link to the app, or search “MyNM” in the App Store for iPhone or
                    Google Play store for Android phones.</p>

                <h2 id="NM_pass">What password do I use to log into the MyNM app?</h2>
                <p>To access information, patients should use their existing NM MyChart login information. If a username
                    or password is forgotten, use the prompts in the MyNM app login page to reset your information. This
                    is a secure method to access medical information and pay medical bills. Those who are not NM MyChart
                    users may register as new users on the app.</p>

                <h2 id="MR_test">When can I see my test results in MyChart?</h2>
                <p>Most test results are released to MyChart as soon as they become available to your doctor*. This can
                    be anywhere from 3 - 7 business days. If you were admitted to one of our hospitals or had an
                    Emergency Room visit, any tests that have been resulted during your stay will be released to MyChart
                    when you're discharged. <br><br>Please keep in mind, your doctor may not always have the opportunity
                    to review your results before they are released to your MyChart account.</p>
                <p><strong>*For safety reasons, some results are not eligible for auto-release to your MyChart account.
                        Please see below for more information.</strong></p>

                <h2 id="MR_share">Why are certain test results not shared electronically via MyChart?</h2>
                <p>Certain test results are considered very sensitive in nature. Due to this, your physician will likely
                    want to discuss these results with you prior to making them available for viewing in MyChart. Also,
                    historical test results from hospital stays and ED visits prior to June 8, 2015 are not available to
                    view in MyChart at this time. <br><br>You always have the option to request a paper copy of your
                    medical records from our Health Information Management department. Please, select this link for

                <p>The <strong>Upcoming Tests and Procedures</strong> activity is a compilation of all current Test or
                    Procedures ordered for you by your Clinician. These orders may require action on your part or could
                    be scheduled at an external facility not directly integrated into NM MyChart. If these are scheduled
                    at a Northwestern Medicine facility these should display in your upcoming appointment activity. </p>

                <h2 id="MR_wrong">Why is some of my health information on MyChart incorrect or missing?</h2>
                <p>Your MyChart information comes directly from your electronic medical record maintained by your
                    doctor's office. Your health information is reviewed and updated in your electronic medical record
                    each visit. At your next clinic visit, talk to your doctor about correcting or adding health
                    information in your record. If your patient portal recently transitioned to MyChart, your MyChart
                    account may be blank when you first sign up. Most users will start seeing their health information
                    in their account after their next doctor's visit.</p>
                <p>If you've been admitted or visited the Emergency Room at Northwestern Memorial or Lake Forest
                    Hospital, but have never had an Office Visit with a Northwestern Medicine doctor, you will not see
                    health information populated in the Medication, Allergy, or Immunization sections of your MyChart
                    account. A summary of your health information can be found on your Discharge/Admission Summary. </p>

                <h2 id="MR_update">When I update my medications and allergies, does that automatically go onto my

                <p>No, this will require a review with your clinician to confirm the updates before it being fully
                    incorporated into your medical record. While you can submit an update at any time this will be
                    reviewed and updated in your record at your next visit with Northwestern Medicine. </p>

                <p>Once you're logged in, hover over the <strong>Messaging</strong> tab and select "Send a Clinical
                    Message". <strong>Any doctor you have had an office visit with in the last 3 years or you will see
                        in the upcoming year</strong> should appear in your dropdown menu of doctors. Once you select
                    the appropriate doctor, you can choose your subject from the list of options.</p>
                <p>To send a message using the MyNM app, log in and click the <strong>Messages</strong> tile from the
                    dashboard. On the next screen, select the green “send a message” button, and follow the onscreen

                    procedure visit, hospital visit, or e-visit in the last 3 years or you have an appointment scheduled
                    with them up to 1 year in the future. <br><br> Other types of encounters will be excluded from

                <p>Unfortunately, MyChart does not allow the ability for us to manually remove a doctor from the list of
                    available doctors you are able to message. Doctors will automatically disappear from your list when
                    it has been 3 years since the last time you have interacted with them via office visit, procedure
                    visit, hospital visit, or e-visit.</p>

                <h2 id="MR_msgattach">Can I send an image or video attachment via message to my physician?</h2>
                <p>Yes. MyChart messaging functionality allows a patient to attach an image, video, or PDF document to a
                    message and send it to their doctor securely. Patients are allowed to submit up to 3 attachments in
                    a message. Attachments that you send via MyChart will automatically be stored in your permanent
                    electronic medical record. Your attachments must be below certain file size and video length limits,
                    which are subject to change. You can view these limits by hovering your mouse cursor over the
                    question mark icon at the bottom of the screen when sending a new message. </p>
                <p>To add an attachment to your message, simply select the Browse button at the bottom of the new
                    message screen, and navigate to the file you would like to attach. Once the file is attached, you
                    will see a preview at the bottom of the screen and you will be able to add a label to describe the
                    attachment. Sending an attachment is just as easy in the MyNM app: on the new message screen, click
                    “Attachments” and select a file from your device to include.</p>

                    each guarantor account as its own separate row. In order to reduce confusion, we have updated the
                    display, so that now each guarantor account is displayed as its own separate card. Each card will
                    list the patients that are covered by that account and the outstanding balance, along with also
                    providing links to view the account details, last statement, and send a billing-related customer
                    service message. As of now, only Personal/Family and NM Lab guarantor account types will display in
                    MyChart. We are working to expand this list in the future.</p>

                <p>MyChart Bill Pay provides you access to bills from visits to any Northwestern Medicine facility.</p>
                <p>If you do not see a bill reflected in NM MyChart please visit <a href="http://mybill.nm.org"

                <p>If you recently were asked to "upgrade" your NM MyChart account, billing information prior to March
                    3, 2018, will not be viewable in NM MyChart. To see or make a payment for a bill generated before
                    March 3, please go to nm.org and click "Pay a Bill".</p>

                <h2 id="BL_apply">Can I apply my payment to specific statements?</h2>
                <p>Yes. When accessing MyChart Bill Pay, your online statement will be pre-populated with the Amount to
                    Pay and the Total Amount Due. When making a payment, you will have the option to select the account
                    to which you wish to apply your payment. If no account is specified, your payment will be applied to
                    the oldest balance on file. </p>

                <h2 id="BL_payplan">Can I setup a payment plan in MyChart?</h2>
                <p>Yes. By navigating to the Account Details page within your guarantor account (<strong>Billing tab
                        &gt; Billing Account Summary &gt; See Account Detail</strong>), you can create a recurring
                    monthly payment plan. In order to be eligible to enroll in a payment plan, you must have a minimum
                    Amount Owed of $25.01 and you must have a monthly payment amount of $25.00 or greater. The maximum
                    number of payments allowed is thirty-six (36). If you currently have a payment plan setup with our
                    billing vendor, Simplee, you will not be allowed to create another payment plan in MyChart (this
                    will be stated in your Account Details page if it applies to your account).</p>
                <p>Once created, your monthly payments will be <u><strong>automatically</strong></u> deducted on the
                    specified date from the credit card you selected. MyChart does not allow the creation of manual
                    payment plans at this time.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> We no longer offer the ability to terminate payment plans via MyChart. To do
                    this, please contact our Billing department at (855) 286-2861. </p>

                <h2 id="BL_view">Who can view MyChart and make payments on accounts?</h2>
                <p>The patient or the patient's designated guarantor, as well as any adult proxies assigned by the
                    guarantor, can access a patient's MyChart and Bill Pay information. For instance, when a bill is
                    created for a child in MyChart, the parent who is the designated guarantor can view the child's
                    MyChart and pay the bill. To provide access to the second parent, the parent who is the guarantor
                    would need to designate the second parent as a proxy. Any adult who is not a designated guarantor or
                    proxy will not be able to access the child's MyChart account.</p>
                <p>If a teen proxy is established and the teen is listed as the guarantor, the patient's MyChart
                    information will not be accessible to either parent. Parents can only view their children's MyChart
                    information when they are the designated guarantor or listed as a proxy.</p>

                <p>Pre Check-In is an activity within an upcoming appointment that allows you to complete various
                    appointment-related tasks within a single workflow from the comfort of your own home. By completing
                    these tasks at home, you will not need to do them when you arrive at your physician's office. With
                    Pre Check-In, you can:</p>
                <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>Verify or update demographics information</li>
                    <li>Electronically sign certain documents</li>
                    <li>Pay outstanding balances, pre-payments, and/or authorize copays</li>
                    <li>Verify or update insurance information and upload images of your insurance card</li>
                    <li>Verify or update medications and allergies information (including preferred pharmacy)</li>
                    <li>Answer appointment-related questionnaires</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To access the Pre Check-In activity, navigate to your Upcoming Appointments page and select one of
                    your upcoming appointments. If your appointment is enabled for Pre Check-In functionality, you will
                    see a section header for "Pre Check-In" and a button asking you to update your information.</p>
                <p>Completing the Pre Check-In activity is voluntary. It is encouraged in order to save you time at your
                    physician's office, but it is not mandatory.</p>

                <p>Not every Reason for Visit is available for scheduling in MyChart at this time. The following
                    considerations may prevent a Reason for Visit from being scheduled:<br></p>
                <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>Patients who are new to a specialty may need to call in and speak to a scheduler in order to
                        establish a new relationship with a provider. The schedulers are able to help take into account
                        certain insurance coverage issues and provider sub-specialties to help you select the clinician
                        most suited to your needs. <br>Please refer to our <a target="_tab"

                        or to find a provider.</li>
                    <li>In general, visits that require pre-work such as labs or procedures will require you to call and
                        make your appointment. </li>
                    <li>Immunizations, vaccinations, and flu shots require supplies to be checked prior to scheduling an
                        appointment to ensure sufficient stock. </li>
                    <li>Visits for more than one appointment reason have special duration considerations that must be
                        handled by a scheduler. </li>
                    <li>Some Pre-op and Post-op visits have very specific timing restrictions.</li>

                <p>Only select areas are participating in MyChart scheduling at this time. If your doctor is not in the
                    list of options for scheduling, it may be due to their specialty not currently having MyChart
                    scheduling activated. We are currently working to expand our list of available specialties. More
                    specialties will become eligible for MyChart scheduling in the following months. If you do not see a
                    specialty listed, it is still being assessed for MyChart scheduling capabilities and may be enabled
                    at a future date that is still to be determined</p>
                <p>If no providers are appearing at all, you likely do not have a visit within the specialty you are
                    scheduling from the past 3 years. Therefore, you are considered a "new" patient, and may have to
                    call to complete the scheduling process. You can contact one of our schedulers directly at one of
                    the locations listed in our <a target="_tab"
                        href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/find-a-doctor">provider directory</a> or in the Find a Doctor

                <p>An electronic visit, or eVisit, lets you communicate online with a Northwestern Medicine physician.
                    An eVisit does not allow for face-face interaction with a physician. When requesting an eVisit, you
                    will fill out an online questionnaire and receive an electronic response from the physician to
                    discuss your symptoms. Currently, eVisits are only available for Dermatology topics. To request an
                    eVisit, you must:</p>
                <ul class="bulleted">
                    <li>Have a Northwestern Medicine MyChart account</li>
                    <li>Have been seen by a Northwestern Dermatologist in the past 3 years</li>
                    <li>Agree to the eVisit terms and conditions</li>
                    <li>Submit a credit card for authorization and potential payment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may request an eVisit only for advice on non-urgent conditions. If you have an urgent need to
                    speak with or see a physician, call your physician, go to the nearest emergency room or <strong>call
                        911</strong>.<strong>For medical emergencies, always call 911 immediately.</strong></p>

                <p>An eVisit costs $60 for follow-up issues. This fee will be preauthorized with the credit card you

                    charged. At this time, Northwestern Medicine will not bill insurance for an eVisit.

                <p>When accessing NM MyChart on a desktop computer, you may only sign in using your username and
                    password. Additional options may be available using the MyNM app, such as logging in with a pin
                    number, a fingerprint, or a face scanner.</p>
                <p>Apple devices with TouchID and FaceID, as well as various Android devices are supported. First, log
                    in with your username and password, and <strong>select the option on the login screen to save your
                        username</strong>. Then visit the Settings page by opening the menu and clicking the gear icon.
                    Select "MyChart Settings" to view and enable the alternative sign-in options compatible with your
                    phone.</p>

                    Notification Settings page, select a section to view a drop-down menu containing rows for different
                    notification types. By selecting the Email icon, you can enable or disable these notifications from
                    being sent to your email on file. If the Email icon is purple, that means it is enabled; if it is
                    not filled in then that means it is disabled. The Mailbox icon means that physical mail will be sent
                    to you for that notification type. If there is a lock icon placed on the Email or Mailbox icons,
                    then that means you cannot edit the setting (it has been set system-wide as an organizational
                    decision). </p>

                <h2 id="TQ_sec">Is MyChart secure?</h2>
                <p>We take great care to ensure your health information is kept private and secure. Access to
                    information is controlled through secure access codes, personal IDs, and passwords. Each person
                    controls their password, and their account cannot be accessed without that password. Furthermore,
                    MyChart uses the latest 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to encrypt your
                    personal information such as username, passwords, and account information over the internet. Any
                    information provided to you is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches your browser. This is
                    the same security used by the online banking industry. Unlike conventional e-mail, all MyChart
                    messaging is done while you are securely logged on to our website. The MyNM app uses these same
                    levels of security.</p>
